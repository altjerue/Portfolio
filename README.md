# This is my Portfolio

Welcome to the portfolio of [Dr. Jes√∫s M. Rueda-Becerril](https://altjerue.github.io).

## DataCamp

In the [DataCamp](./DataCamp/) directory, you will find some projects that I have worked on while sharpening my Data Science skills in [DataCamp learning platform](https://datacamp.com)

You can also find my [DataCamp portfolio here](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/jmruebe)

### List of projects

#### [Sleep Disorders predictor](./DataCamp/sleep/sleep_data.ipynb)

In this project I analyse a dataset to investigate what factors may contribute to sleep disorders, and I build a Logistic Regressor to predict if a client has sleep disorders.

#### [What's in an Avocado Toast](./DataCamp/avocado_toast/avocado_toast_analysis.ipynb)

In this project I perform a supply chain analysis of the main ingridients of the famous dish *Avocado toast*: avocado, olive oil and sourdough. I perform a deep data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find where these ingrediantes most commonly originate from.

## Kaggle

I will be posting in [Kaggle](./Kaggle/) projects that I have completed in the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com)

## Other projects

### Gists

I have a [collection of GitHubGists](https://gist.github.com/altjerue) that you are welcome to check out!

### Advent of Code and Project Euler

As a good practice to keep coding skills sharp, I like to work on the problems posted in both [AOC](https://adventofcode.com) and [PE](https://projecteuler.net). My solutions can be found:
