# This is my Portfolio

Welcome my portfolio! Also feel welcome to visit my [personal webpage](https://altjerue.github.io)

## AI & ML

I will be posting in [AIML](./AIML/) projects that are helping me solidify the concepts behind AI and Machine Learning.

- [Neural Network from scratch](./AIML/neuralnet_from_scratch.py): solved the XOR problem with a two-layer neural network, built from scratch.

- [Decision Tree from scratch](./AIML/dectree_from_scratch.py): implemented a decision tree to classify Iris flowers.

- [Random Forest from scratch](./AIML/ranforest_from_scratch.py): implemented a random forest algorithm from scratch to classify Iris flowers, and compared accuracy with the results from a single Decision Tree.

### Other projects

In the [DataCamp](./DataCamp/) directory, you will find some projects that I have worked on while sharpening my Data Science skills in [DataCamp learning platform](https://datacamp.com)

You can also find my [DataCamp portfolio here](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/jmruebe)

#### [Sleep Disorders predictor](./DataCamp/sleep/sleep_data.ipynb)

In this project I analyse a dataset to investigate what factors may contribute to sleep disorders, and I build a Logistic Regressor to predict if a client has sleep disorders.

#### [What's in an Avocado Toast](./DataCamp/avocado_toast/avocado_toast_analysis.ipynb)

In this project I perform a supply chain analysis of the main ingridients of the famous dish *Avocado toast*: avocado, olive oil and sourdough. I perform a deep data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find where these ingrediantes most commonly originate from.

#### [Nobel Prizes](./DataCamp/nobel_prizes/nobel_prizes.ipynb)

In this project I run an exploratory data analysis on the Nobel Prize database through the decades to find, e.g., trends of gender, age, for differnt categories, using linear regression.

## Advent of Code and Project Euler

As a good practice to keep coding skills sharp, I like to work on the problems posted in both [AOC](https://adventofcode.com) and [PE](https://projecteuler.net). My solutions can be found:
